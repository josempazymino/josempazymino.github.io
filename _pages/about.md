I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Department of Social Sciences at [Universidad Catolica del Uruguay](https://ucu.edu.uy/en/en). 

I received my PhD from [Indiana University](https://economics.indiana.edu/). My research interest is industrial organization with a focus on (i) measurement and determinants of firm conduct and (ii) how political economy factors shape markets.
